# ThingSpeakPortal
This is a small esp8266-01 sketch that listens for json strings on the serial port, parses them and then sends the fields to a ThingSpeak channel. ThingSpeakPortalClient is a class that can be dropped into your arduino code to simplify pushing data to your ThingSpeak channel through your ThingSpeakPortal device.

# programming
I've been using a usb flashing tool, BB-ESPADP, that I found on Tindie.  This thing is really slick and makes programming these little ESP8266-01 boards pretty painless.
